A data nerd at heart, Adam majored in Economics at CSUSB, and has used his data-analysis powers mainly for good. Like many of his generation, he was drawn to coding and design originally as an angsty teen trying to make his MySpace page look cool‚Äìbut not too cool.</p>\n<p>Since those days he has been pretty busy both in-house and as a freelancer, and with his YouTube channel where he teaches people how to use Sketch. He has a variety of experience such as creating custom WordPress themes, UI design, and speaks fluent HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Liquid. (note from editor: one could also add<br />\nsarcasm to that list)</p>\n<p>Adam‚Äôs loves to tackle a challenge head-on by analyzing it and coming up with a plan to solve the needs of his clients that makes sense for their big-picture goals. Most recently, he‚Äôs working at <a href=\"http://bvaccel.com\">BVAccel</a> as a Front-end Developer in sunny San Diego, and previously, he was a Lead Shopify Developer at <a href=\"https://blenderseyewear.com\">Blenders Eyewear</a>.
