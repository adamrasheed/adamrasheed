## Need some help on a Project? Let’s talk.
For the last 5 years, I've been running a small
<a href="//creatix.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">design/development consultancy</a> where I work with small business to help them increase their revenue. Lately, I've
been working a lot with agencies like
<a href="https://www.epublishing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ePublishing</a> and
<a href="https://dotdash.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dot Dash</a> to help with their projects. I'd love to work with your’s too!

## Things I’m Good at:
- **Effective Communcation.** Seriously, I'll make sure to understand the needs of the project before taking it on and keep you in the loop throughout the whole project.
- **Looking at the underlying business goals at hand.** A lot of times, what the clients really need isn't what they originally come to your agency for. That‘s where having some solid conversation with them is useful.

## Things I can help you with:
- **Holy Trinity:** HTML, CSS, Javascript. All the things I utilized to build rad MySpace pages in 2006.

- **Wordpress:** This includes custom themes and large-scale migration and optimization work. PHP and I have become very good friends.

- **Shopify:** I started doing custom shopify themes this year, (my favorite on being <a href="/case-studies/flexrake">Flexrake</a>), and I'm in love with liquid.

- **Large-Scale CSS Architecture:** Have a large project you need to make sure doesn't go awry or have an older site you need to retrofit to into a fully-responsive progressive web app that works on all devices regardless of data speed? I can help using the powers of SCSS and BEM.


## Things I'm Learning:

- **React:** I've been dabbling in small react projects, and recently have started a portfolio piece that uses React in the frontend and hooks up to a wordpress backend through WP's REST API.

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):** I'm learning how important it is to make projects accessible to not only those with disabilities or impairments, but also those without access to high-speed internet or flagship phones. I'm currently learning how to retrofit my past projects into progressive web apps.

- **ES7:** Im currently learning Async Await to replace fetch (the way I currently hook into APIs).
